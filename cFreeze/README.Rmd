The purpose of cFreeze is to help corn seed growers understand the potential risk of freeze damage at harvest time. cFreeze calculates the percent occurrence of temperatures below zero degrees Celsius for any day of the year, given the GPS coordinates for a location of interest and the last 30-year historical weather data extracted from Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) closest to that location.
